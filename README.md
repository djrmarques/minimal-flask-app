# minimal-flask-app

This is just my personal minimal Flask App that I use to bootstrap other projects. Anytime I use flask after some time I always have to figure out again out to set it up. Now I just fork this repo. 

This contains the following: 

- Minimal FLask App
- Makefile with relevant commands
- Dockerfile to generate a docker image
- Github actions to generate a Docker image and publish it on Github packages
