# Minimal Flask App

This is just my personal minimal Flask App that I use to bootstrap other projects. Anytime I use flask after some time I always have to figure out again out to set it up. Now I just fork this repo. 

This projects contains the following: 

- Minimal code for a Flask App;
- Makefile with relevant commands;
- Dockerfile to generate docker image;
- Github actions to generate a Docker image and publish it on Github packages.
- Dependabot for github actions

I may end up adding other features or slightly altering the folder structure as I go. 

# How to use
Either clone or fork this repo, and then start altering the existing code however you want. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) how to duplicate a repo.
